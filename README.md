#**Binder Program Documentation**
**Application Purpose:**
The "Binder" program enables users to launch specific applications on their computer using selected key combinations on their keyboard.

**How It Works:**
The Binder program operates by registering and monitoring predefined key combinations. When an user selects a combination, the program opens the assigned application.

**User Interaction:**
Binder provides users with a user-friendly interface for configuring key combinations and assigning them to apps. This allows users to easily customize the application's behavior to suit their needs.

##**More Features**
Password Protection: Users can now set passwords for assigned key combinations, providing additional security.
User Notifications: Implementation of notifications for users informing them of success or any issues encountered during application launches.
Settings Cleanup: Addition of a settings cleanup feature allowing users to remove all previously configured key combinations and go back to default settings.

**Limitations**
At present, Binder is limited to basic applications, primarily those located on the C drive. We plan to expand the application by adding new features to provide users with even greater convenience.
