# **Binder Program Documentation**
**Application Purpose:**
The "Binder" program enables users to launch specific applications on their computer using selected key combinations on their keyboard.


**How It Works:**
The Binder program operates by registering and monitoring predefined key combinations. When an user selects a combination, the program opens the assigned application.


**User Interaction:**
Binder provides users with a user-friendly interface for configuring key combinations and assigning them to apps. This allows users to easily customize the application's behavior to suit their needs.


# **More Features**
Password Protection: Users can now set passwords for assigned key combinations, providing additional security.

User Notifications: Implementation of notifications for users informing them of success or any issues encountered during application launches.

Settings Cleanup: Addition of a settings cleanup feature allowing users to remove all previously configured key combinations and go back to default settings.


**Limitations**
Binder is no longer limited to applications located only on the C drive, now, it prompts up a file explorer in which you can choose almost any application youve got saved!



# **Testing**

I have done testing the application by its functionality and it works perfectly with some additional tweaks added by me. Tested stuff such as saving hotkeys, starting apps and the password and cleaning system.

*I also done some debugging and came across a bug that does not let you open an app after setting the keybind, should be all fixed now by adding the subprocess possibility.
